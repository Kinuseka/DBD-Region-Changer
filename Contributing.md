# Contributing Reminders

## When contributing
 - Ensure to use logs when you require stdout to be published to main, ensure that it is useful to the developer and the user and not anything unnecessary or obvious.
 - You can use `print()` but do not forget to remove it afterwards after you're done.
 - Follow the code structure, do not deviate too much

## Before submitting a pull request or pushing to main
 - Ensure you have tested it and it is running properly
 - Ensure that it works specifically not only in your machine 
 - Remove any unnecessary prints
